            T'Challa is a fictional character portrayed by Chadwick Boseman in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchiseâ€”based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. He is initially depicted as the prince of the fictional African nation of Wakanda who holds the appointed title[2] of Black Panther. 
            <br><br>
            He uses an advanced vibranium suit and is imbued with superhuman strength and agility granted to him by the heart-shaped herb, as a blessing bestowed upon him by Wakanda's patron deity Bast, from whom the visage of the Black Panther mantle assumed by the chosen royal members is representative and evocative of.

After the murder of his father T'Chaka, T'Challa becomes king and finds himself in the midst of a conflict between the Avengers. After discovering the culprit was Helmut Zemo, T'Challa subdues him. He comes into conflict with his cousin Erik Stevens who usurps the throne, but eventually wins it back and thwarts Stevens' attempt to use Wakanda's vast technological resources to conquer the world. 
<br><br>
T'Challa has a son with Nakia and during the conflict against Thanos, leads the Wakandan armies alongside the Avengers, but falls victim to the Blip. After being restored to life by the Avengers, he joins them in a final and victorious battle against Thanos before rejoining his family. However, T'Challa succumbs to an undisclosed illness and passes away, his title is passed on to his younger sister, Shuri.

Originally intended to become a central MCU character, <i>T'Challa</i> appeared in just four MCU films before Boseman died of colon cancer in August 2020. Kevin Feige confirmed that the character would not be recast nor would a digital double be used for any future live-action depictions of <i>T'Challa</i>.

<br>
 Boseman's performance as <i>T'Challa</i> was lauded as being one of the first African-American superheroes in a big-budget film, and he received critical acclaim for his portrayal of the character. His titular film became the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
<br><br>
Alternate versions of T'Challa from within the MCU multiverse appear in the first season of the animated series, What If...? (2021), with Boseman posthumously reprising the final role. Most notable is a depiction of T'Challa as Star-Lord, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. In October 2021, a spin-off series centered on the Star-Lord T'Challa was revealed to be in development hell due to Boseman's death.
