            The Black Panther is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Fantastic Four #52 in 1966. The Black Panther's real name is T'Challa, and he is the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. T'Challa assumes the mantle of the Black Panther, a ceremonial title given to the chief of the Panther Tribe, after the death of his father, King T'Chaka.

            The character is known for his enhanced strength, agility, and senses, which are heightened by ingesting the heart-shaped herb, a plant native to Wakanda. He is also highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and a master strategist.
            
            As the Black Panther, T'Challa has appeared in numerous comic book series, as well as animated television shows, video games, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). In the MCU, the character is portrayed by actor Chadwick Boseman, who tragically passed away in 2020.
