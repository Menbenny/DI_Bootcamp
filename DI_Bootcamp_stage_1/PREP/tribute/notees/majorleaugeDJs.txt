Major League DJz
Major League DJz consists of twins Bandile and Banele. This twin set is a 
dynamic duo bringing fresh energy to every platform they engage with. 
Born in Boston, USA, the twins moved to South Africa after the apartheid era. 
Being exposed to music at a very young age, Major League DJz were highly 
influenced by the sounds of Jazz and Hip-Hop music which ushered them 
into the entertainment industry in their early teens.

The duo’s vision is to use music to unify youth across Africa. 
Major League DJz aspire to play music for Africa by Africans in an attempt to 
change the perception of African Hip Hop. The twins are well on their way to 
achieving this goal through their Urban Breeze events which currently occur 
weekly in the Alexandra township and have 
steered up a generous Hip Hop following in an otherwise House music dominated 
territory.

FEATURES AND EVENTS
The twins have hosted parties for the likes of 50 Cent, Akon and Fat Joe, and 
have played alongside both local and international artists such as DJ Fresh, 
Euphonik, Roger Goode, DJ Trauma, DJ Drama and DJ Woo Kid. Major League 
DJz can be spotted at all the hottest clubs and parties across South Africa.

Young, talented and good looking, Major League DJz are the full package. 
Official DJs 
for Khuli Chana and Soul Candi eventorganisers, the twins are at the 
forefront of the youth market. Major League DJz provide weekly mixes for 
uKhozi FM and 
Mafikeng FM and are ambassadors for the McDonald’s Street Rhythm campaign.
